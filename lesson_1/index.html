                This Black Forest Cake is elegant, decadent, and gorgeous. Cherries and whipped cream tucked between layers of tender chocolate cake brushed with a cherry syrup is everything a special occasion cake should be.
                Black Forest Cake is a show-stopping dessert. Rich chocolate cake is moistened with an extra flavorful cherry syrup and then layered with freshly whipped cream, cherries, and chocolate shavings in this recipe. It's great for a special holiday or a summer picnic.

                If you find yourself looking to expand your dessert repertoire, this Black Forest Cake will not disappoint.

                What Is Black Forest Cake?
            </h1>
            <p>
                Black Forest Cake is based on the German dessert "Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte," which translates to "Black Forest Cherry-torte." Though some may think Black Forest Cake is named after a mountain range in the country, that is actually a myth. It's named after the kirsch made from Black Forest Cherries. If the cake doesn't have the kirsch, it can't be called Black Forest.
